## Login:
    On the login page, enter one of the username/password combinations provided below the form and click the Login button

## Role:
    There are two roles involved in the bug tracking process: Developer and Submitter.  Each user is assigned one of these roles.  Logging in as a submitter allows you to log a new bug and assign a developer to handle it.  Logging in as a developer allows you to see the bugs assigned to you and "squash" them when they are completed.

## Live Bugs:
    All users are taken to the Live Bugs page upon logging in.  This page shows all of the bugs currently active.

## Dead Bugs:
    This page shows bugs that were active at one time but have been "squashed" by the developer.

## Profile:
    This page shows the users information and allows them to log out.

## New Bug:
    Submitters are able to access the New Bug page.  Here, they are able to fill out the form and log a new bug.  Each bug should have a clear description, a priority level, and a developer assigned to it.  

## My Bugs:
    Developers have access to the My Bugs page.  This page shows the active or "live" bugs currently assigned to the user.  The user can click the Squash button when the issue is resolved to remove the bug from the Live Bugs list and send it to the Dead Bugs list.
